- **Your name:** Margaret Nieves Gonzales

**Description:**
- This is a website that showcases some things about the filipino culture for our filipino club. There are 3 main pages which are some parts about filipino history, a little bit about filipino myhology and different filipino foods.

**What was the hardest part about making this website?**
- I would say one of the hardest parts was making the navigation bar go on top of the slideshow and when the user opens the nav bar that all the contant on the page would shift to the right to make room for the nav bar. Another one of the hardest parts was getting the button for the see ore working because it was the first time i used any javascript.

**What is the most interesting part of the website?**
- I would say the most interesting part would be hovering over the different foods and reading about the different mythologies.
